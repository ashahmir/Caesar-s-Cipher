# 🏛️ Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder

A simple and interactive implementation of the **Caesar Cipher** — an ancient encryption technique — built in Python.

This program allows you to **encode** or **decode** messages by shifting letters across the alphabet, preserving all non-alphabetic characters like punctuation, numbers, and spaces.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Encode messages with any positive shift value
- 🔓 Decode previously encoded messages
- 🔁 Automatically wraps around the alphabet (`z` to `a`)
- 💬 Handles symbols, numbers, spaces without encryption
- 🧠 Works even with large shift values (like `59`, `105`, etc.)
